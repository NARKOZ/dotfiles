This is my HOME, including shell environment, vim
configuration, and other misc dotfiles and scripts.

I didn't write all of this stuff, or even most of it.
I've tried to include proper attribution and info on
distribution and licensing in each of the file's I
found elsewhere. Please contact me if you see something
not so attributed.

Have fun.
